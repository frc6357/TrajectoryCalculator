# TrajectoryCalculator
### This program runs on java and reads JSON files
This program is meant to be able to calculate a cubic spline problem given specific parameters and feed the resulting path to a .json file. With this the robot is able to follow a computed path during different periods of any match and this is implementable year over year.
